# Gravity Model

This calculates trade between regions for a single given commodity
using a fully constrained gravity model
 
Commodity supply and demand for each region as well as a distances between
regions and impedence factor (weights on distance) are the required inputs
 
Gravity model Based on Wilson, A.G. (1967), A Statistical Theory of
Spatial Distribution Models. Transportation Research 1 (3), pp. 252-270.
